### Project Proposal

There were thousands of publishers and book traders in the 19th century, why do some last longer than others? There may have been external factors, such as a lack of demand or recessions. In recent years, books are mainly used for academic purposes and recreational reading but with the rising use of e-books (especially during the pandemic), paper-based books may face the same issue as in the 19th century (low demand). I wanted to write a book as a child but have never gotten around to do it, but it might still happen. Answering this question may help me and other publishers anticipate the obstacles of publishing.

This [dataset](https://repository.upenn.edu/mead/28/) includes information (name, start and end year, and address) of individuals and firms involved in the manufacture and distribution of childrens’ books in the United States in the 19th century. This includes non-profit publishers and educational pioneers. The dataset can show the growth of the print industry, specifically childrens’ books, and most probably childrens’ ability to read at the time.

The intended analysis would be looking at what the starting years are for the longer-running distributors to see if they went through a recession (will most likely be made into a bar graph) and who the publishers are (were they a person of power, influence, or simply opened a store for profit).

With this research, I hope to be able to find out what made some book distributors successful/long-lasting while others barely lasted a year. As times change, these factors may change but I believe that these factors are still relevant today since this research will be looking at outside factors (demand and monetary availability of the public).
