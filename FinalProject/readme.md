### Project Proposal

Video games have grown popular over the years, it is now possible to play video games for a living. This is usually done through YouTube videos, streaming, or competitive e-sports. Gaming can be made into a career, where some people essentially depend on consistently pumping gaming content to earn money. The most important question that comes to mind is: which genre do people spend more time on?

This [dataset](https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/csv/video_games/) shows information regarding the games' title, average play time (various playthough styles), publisher, whether it is handheld or not, etc. The dataset was initially made to predict the likelihood of a video game becoming a block-buster title based on observable characteristics. This goes hand in hand with how successful one be when using these games to stream/make videos. If a certain genre or publisher has longer playtime in total (counting leisure, speedrun, story only, completionist, etc.), people may migrate to those titles. 

As of now, I believe that Nintendo is one of the biggest gaming publishers especially since the dataset only includes games released between 2004 and 2008. These are the years when Nintendo was prevalent, to my knowledge. Nintendo mostly had stimulation games, with some action and puzzles, so these are the genres that would most likely be played the most.

I will be looking for more video game data from more recent years to see if the trend of played genres and publishers have changed. In the meantime, I hope to find out which genres and publishers are popular based on the data I already have. With this, rising gamers may be able to use this data to boost their career.
